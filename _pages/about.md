### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-cat" aria-hidden="true"></i> About me
I am an Assistant Professor of [Computer Science](https://www.uta.edu/academics/schools-colleges/engineering/academics/departments/cse) at [Georege Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) (GWU). Here is my current [CV](/files/ASullivan_CV.pdf).

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. Candidate of Computer Science in George Washington University (GWU). My advisor is Xiuzhen Cheng. I obtained my MS. degree in computer science in 2012 and my B.S. degree in networking engineering in 2009 from Qufu Normal University.

  I love puzzles just as much as my cat likes laying out over all the puzzle pieces. In my downtime, I play video games: I have a weekly discord get together with all my close friends in Texas. I equally enjoy getting out of the house. Since I stopped running marathons, I've taken to hiking -- I have a goal to visit every national park in the United States. I am also eager to get out and explore the world -- I enjoy backpacking with my husband internationally.
