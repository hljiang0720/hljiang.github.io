  I love puzzles just as much as my cat likes laying out over all the puzzle pieces. In my downtime, I play video games: I have a weekly discord get together with all my close friends in Texas. I equally enjoy getting out of the house. Since I stopped running marathons, I've taken to hiking -- I have a goal to visit every national park in the United States. I am also eager to get out and explore the world -- I enjoy backpacking with my husband internationally.
