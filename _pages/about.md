### <i class="fa fa-fw fa-smile-wink" aria-hidden="true"></i> About me
I am a Ph.D. candidate of [Computer Science](https://www.cs.seas.gwu.edu/) at [George Washington University](https://www.gwu.edu/) (GWU). Here is my current [CV](/files/ASullivan_CV.pdf).

I’m pursuing my Ph.D. in Computer Science under supervision of Professor Xiuzhen Cheng. I obtained my M.S. degree in computer science in 2012 and my B.S. degree in networking engineering in 2009 from Qufu Normal University.

  I love drawing and cooking with my dear daughter. She is my sunshine. We like getting out of house, hiking and visiting national parks.
